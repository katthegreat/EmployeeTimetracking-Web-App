feat: Add backend console login and WIP frontend setup

This commit captures the current state of the project as a work in progress.

✅ Backend (Java):
- Main.java:
  Console-based login handling.
  - Admin login (username: admin, password: adminpass).
  - Employee login using first name and password 'emppass'.
  - Establishes MySQL connection via Dotenv.
  - Creates default admin user if not present.

- AdminMenu.java:
  - Console menu for admin users.
  - View all employees.
  - Update hourly rate and job titles.

- EmployeeMenu.java:
  - Console menu for employees.
  - Punch in/out functionality with validation to prevent duplicate punches.

- LoginServer.java (moved to web folder):
  - Initial web server setup using Spark and Gson (not yet fully integrated).

✅ Frontend:
- Some initial attempts at frontend structure (HTML/CSS/JS) in time-tracking-frontend folder (work in progress).

✅ Notes:
- Project is in early stages.
- Console login and employee/admin functionality are working.
- Frontend is not yet connected to backend.
- Requires MySQL database and proper .env configuration.`
